        <p>
            It's no secret that the dating scene in college can be quite large. Some students have it easier,
            while others may experience a more difficult time navigating the dating life in hopes of finding "the one".
            As undergraduate students at the University of Washington, we know how challenging it can be for young students in the dating realm,
            especially because of the different number of dating apps out there, such as <a href="https://tinder.com/">Tinder,</a> <a href="https://hinge.co/">Hinge,</a>
            <a href="https://bumble.com/">Bumble,</a> <a href="https://www.match.com/">Match,</a> and so on. All of these
            different options can cause students to feel overwhelmed and not know where to start. Students also don't want to deal
            with the natural consequences that come along with dating, like getting ghosted, being left on read, having someone turn out to be
            completely opposite of what you expected, and many more. With all these considerations in mind, our team would like to create
            an online dating web application for University of Washington students.
