    <h1>Group BB1 Project Proposal: Dating Web Application</h1>

        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            It's no secret that the dating scene in college can be quite large. Some students have it easier,
            while others may experience a more difficult time navigating the dating life in hopes of finding "the one".
            As undergraduate students at the University of Washington, we know how challenging it can be for young students in the dating realm,
            especially because of the different number of dating apps out there, such as <a href="https://tinder.com/">Tinder,</a> <a href="https://hinge.co/">Hinge,</a>
            <a href="https://bumble.com/">Bumble,</a> <a href="https://www.match.com/">Match,</a> and so on. All of these
            different options can cause students to feel overwhelmed and not know where to start. Students also don't want to deal
            with the natural consequences that come along with dating, like getting ghosted, being left on read, having someone turn out to be
            completely opposite of what you expected, and many more. With all these considerations in mind, our team would like to create
            an online dating web application for University of Washington students.

            There are a number of information technology problems in this space. One obvious one is that there are
            just too many dating app options. The amount of possibilities causes people to feel overwhelmed, especially those who are new to online dating,
            and unsure of which option actually works. There's also a lot of them that have already fallen off the grid, so it's better to have
            just a few options that work well. Scams and the spread of misinformation online is a common issue as well, making it easy for
            a person to pose as someone completely different. Tinder is a popular existing dating app that has tried to help people date successfully,
            but the Tinder bubble can be too big for UW students who just want to meet other UW students. Another big issue with apps like Tinder is that
            they can be extremely surface-level. Just by seeing what a person looks like on the outside, a person is able to reject that person with one swipe.
            These are just a few key problems that are worth solving.
